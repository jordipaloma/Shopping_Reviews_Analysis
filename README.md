# Online Shopping Reviews Analysis in Python
We have a dataset (rating_per_user.json) where every row represents the collection of
received ratings related to a transaction from a seller to a buyer, or the opposite, during the
same period. Every row is a different user. You can find the description of the attributes of
the dataset in the file dataset characteristics.
We would like you to do the following exercises.

#### Exercise 1
Do an exploratory analysis using python to try to understand the dataset and to answer the
following questions:

1. What is the period where these ratings were collected?
2. What is the distribution of the number of ratings users?
3. What is the average of the rating value?
4. What differences are there between ratings SellerToBuyer and BuyerToSeller?
We are expecting a clear and reproducible notebook in python answering all the precious
questions in the most clear way.

#### Exercise 2
Do a presentation with all the findings and insights that you have found in this dataset and
some conclusions in case you have detected something interesting.
